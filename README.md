# Inverted AI map converter

This is an experimental converter for OpenDRIVE maps to make them compatible
with the Inverted AI API.
It is a fork of [CommonRoad Scenario Designer](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-scenario-designer),
currently with minimal modifications.

Use the `convert_map.py` script as the entry point. Note that this is WIP and the results are currently very rough.
