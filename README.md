# Inverted AI map converter

This is an experimental converter for OpenDRIVE maps to make them compatible
with the Inverted AI API.
It is a fork of [CommonRoad Scenario Designer](https://github.com/CommonRoad/commonroad-scenario-designer),
currently with minimal modifications.

The dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file in the usual way.
Use the `convert_map.py` script as the entry point.

Note that at the moment the converter only supports a subset of OpenDRIVE features.
More will be added over time and feature requests accompanied by example .xodr files are welcome.
